3) **Apply baseline org settings**
- default branch `main`
- Actions policy (prefer allowlist)
- enable security features (Dependabot/secret scanning as available)

4) **Create teams**
- `core` (+ optional `contributors`)
- prefer team-based CODEOWNERS

5) **Create first repos**
- `.github` (templates/workflows/policies)
- `meta` / `roadmap` (charter, decisions, RFCs)

6) **Protect `main` on initial repos**
- PR required, checks required, 1–2 reviews, block force-push

6) **Protect `main` on initial repos**
- PR required, checks required, 1–2 reviews, block force-push

If you want, I can also add a short “SOP summary” page at the top of that DocC bundle (so the landing page is literally the checklist).

Yes. The current standard-operating-procedure is now captured as a **provisioned DocC bundle**:

- `provisioned/wrkstrm-org-design-system-0/wrkstrm-org-design-system.docc`
  - `orgs/org-spin-up.md` (the SOP checklist)
  - `orgs/security-baseline.md`
  - `orgs/repo-scaffolding.md`

**In plain terms, the SOP for creating a new org (e.g. `tau`) is:**

1) **Pre-flight decisions**
- org handle + scope (1 sentence)
- 2–3 initial human Owners
- plan/billing + private repo needs

2) **Create org (GitHub UI)**
- enforce 2FA
- default: Owners-only repo creation

Ok, so what is the current process for creating a new org? Do we have a standard-operating-procedure?

---

### open-claw-clia — 2026-02-17T18:41:54Z
You’re right — in *this* repo layout, **“provisioned” literally means `code/mono/provisioned/*`**, not “a new DocC bundle under the Pages tree”.

I fixed it:

- Moved the DocC bundle to:
  - `code/mono/provisioned/wrkstrm-org-design-system-0/wrkstrm-org-design-system.docc/`
- Committed in mono:
  - `ebbe2e506` — “Provision wrkstrm-org-design-system DocC bundle”
- And I **removed it from** `orgs/wrkstrm/public/docc/pages/wrkstrm.github.io` by reverting that earlier commit inside the `wrkstrm.github.io` repo:
  - `72def8c` — revert “Add wrkstrm-org-design-system DocC bundle”

So now it’s “provisioned” in the strict sense.

If you tell me which site should surface it (likely `wrkstrm.github.io`), I can add the minimal index/linking needed so it shows up in navigation—without running any publish/regenerate step.

Provisioned literally means going into the provisioned directory.

### open-claw-clia — 2026-02-17T18:35:35Z
Created a new provisioned DocC bundle in the Wrkstrm Pages repo:

- `orgs/wrkstrm/public/docc/pages/wrkstrm.github.io/wrkstrm-org-design-system.docc/`
  - `index.md` (TechnologyRoot)
  - `orgs/org-spin-up.md` (the checklist)
  - `orgs/repo-scaffolding.md`
  - `orgs/security-baseline.md`

I also committed it in `wrkstrm.github.io`:
- commit: `c2ac752` — “Add wrkstrm-org-design-system DocC bundle”

Next step (when you want it published): push the `wrkstrm.github.io` repo (and then the mono parent submodule pointer if that’s your flow).

This is great: I want a provisioned docc website called wrkstrm-org-design-system.docc that documents this.

### open-claw-clia — 2026-02-17T18:31:15Z
Two quick questions to lock the process:
1) Do you want org creation to be **manual in the GitHub UI** (recommended) or do we want a **gh CLI** scripted setup after it exists?
2) Who are the initial **Owners** for `tau`?

**5) Branch protection + required checks**
- On each repo: protect `main`
  - require PR
  - require status checks (CI)
  - require review (1–2)
  - require linear history (optional)
  - block force-push

**6) “Done” criteria**
- Owners can’t lose access (at least 2 owners)
- 2FA enforced
- `.github` exists
- At least one “meta” repo exists with scope/charter
- Default protections applied to initial repos

If you want, I can turn this into a pinned “Org Spin-Up SOP” doc we reuse for every new org (Tau, etc.).

**3) Governance + access model**
- Create teams (minimal but future-proof):
  - `owners` (GitHub “Owners” is separate, but still useful as a team)
  - `core` (write/admin on core repos)
  - optional: `contributors` (triage)
- Decide CODEOWNERS strategy (team-based, not individual-based)

**4) Org-wide repo scaffolding**
Create these first (mirrors “wrkstrm feel”):
- `.github` (org-wide defaults)
  - PR/issue templates
  - default CODEOWNERS (if you want)
  - baseline CI workflows (lint/test/release) you can re-use
  - SECURITY.md / support policy
- `meta` (or `roadmap`)
  - charter, decision log, RFCs, naming conventions
- `docs` / website repo (only if Tau needs a public face immediately)
