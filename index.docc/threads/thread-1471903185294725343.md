## Intent

Capture the incident/investigation thread and verify/restore missing content on wrkstrm.app.

### Definition of done
- Incident investigation thread has a clear summary, evidence pointers, and follow-ups
- wrkstrm.app missing content is reproduced, root-caused (content vs build vs routing vs submodule pin), and fixed or queued with a concrete next action
- Any required pointer/submodule bumps are promoted forward (no resets)
