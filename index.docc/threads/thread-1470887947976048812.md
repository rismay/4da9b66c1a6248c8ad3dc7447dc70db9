## Intent

We need a deterministic checklist to merge forward from todo3 and incorporate weekend changes without submodule/worktree breakages.

### Definition of done
- Branch reconciliation plan exists (ordered list, conflict policy)
- Known blockers enumerated (SSH, broken pins, missing commits)
- At least one target branch merged forward (or safely retired)
