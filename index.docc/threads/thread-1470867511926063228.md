## Intent

We need OpenClaw’s agent system to work with the CLIA agent system (interop), and then fully detach so each can evolve independently.

### Definition of done
- Interop contract exists (interfaces, message envelope, lifecycle, capabilities) and is documented
- OpenClaw can invoke CLIA agents (and/or vice versa) through the contract in at least one end-to-end flow
- Detachment plan executed or queued with explicit cut points (repos, dependencies, build/publish pipelines)
- No circular deps; versioning strategy defined
