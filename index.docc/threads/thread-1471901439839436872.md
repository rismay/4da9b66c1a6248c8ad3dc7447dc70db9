## Intent

Standardize Mission Control execution: every task gets a dedicated thread for recaps + DONE/BLOCKED pings.

### Definition of done
- Naming convention is fixed: 🚀-pM.m-<statusEmoji>-<tagEmojis>-<slug>
- Thread kickoff message includes on-disk path + 1-line DoD
- Operator pings happen on DONE/BLOCKED
