I can’t change the Discord thread name from here, but here’s the exact rename to do:

Rename:
`🚨-S0-🔴-weekend-merge-unblock`
to:
`✅-S0-weekend-merge-unblock`

How: open the thread → click the thread title at the top → **Edit Thread** (or thread menu `…`) → change **Thread Name** → Save.

I can’t rename Discord threads directly from this chat context.

To set it to the right status, please rename the thread prefix to:

- `✅-S0-...` (complete)

Given the current name, change:
`🚨-S0-🔴-weekend-merge-unblock` → `✅-S0-weekend-merge-unblock` (or keep your extra badge ordering if you use one).

Ok so at least update your thread name to the right status

---

### open-claw-clia — 2026-02-13T17:24:59Z
Yes.

- If you want it **done + preserved**, set the thread name/status to **✅** and then **Archive Thread** (Discord thread menu → *Archive Thread*). That keeps it readable but stops new chatter by default.
- If you want it **hard-frozen**, also **lock** it (if you have perms): thread menu → *Lock Thread* (prevents non-mod posting even if unarchived).

I can’t click the Discord UI from here, but the protocol is: ✅ rename → archive (→ lock if you want true freeze).

### _rismay — 2026-02-13T17:24:48Z
Can we archive this thread or freeze it now?

---

### open-claw-clia — 2026-02-13T17:24:12Z
Locked in. I updated **clia-design-system** to standardize the state badges:

- 🔵 = working / active
- 🛑 = blocked
- ✅ = complete
(+ `pending` maps to ⚪️ in the auto-mode channel badge)

Committed in `orgs/clia-org` as:
`566d4c3 clia-design-system: standardize status badges (🔵 🛑 ✅)`

---

### _rismay — 2026-02-13T17:22:45Z
Lock it in and update the clia-design-system.

---

### open-claw-clia — 2026-02-13T17:19:23Z
Agreed. I’d lock it in as:

- 🔵 = active / working
- 🛑 = blocked / stop
- ✅ = complete

…and keep the thread prefix format consistent so it’s machine-parseable (same position/order every time). If you want, paste the current “on disk” status schema and I’ll draft the minimal diff to migrate existing threads without breaking anything.

Great update protocol.
