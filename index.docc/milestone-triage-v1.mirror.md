# Milestone — Triage v1: executive summary + milestones + daily activity

Owner: `cadence`

## Definition of done

- Executive summary is the landing surface (Next assigned, risks, wins, milestones, metrics)
- Milestone pages exist (curated) and render critical-path threads as DocC cards
- Daily activity page is generated from the latest run and includes explicit follow-ups
